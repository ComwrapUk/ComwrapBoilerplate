### The `decorate` Function
Here's a breakdown of what the code does:
1. It retrieves the children of the first child element of the  `block`  element and stores them in the  `infoGraphic`  array.
2. It creates a new  `div`  element and adds the class name  `span-arrow`  to it.
3. It inserts the newly created  `div`  element after the last child element of the  `infoGraphic`  array.
4. It checks if the  `infoGraphic`  array has more than 0 elements and adds the class name  `info-graphic-img`  to the first element in the array.


### Summary
Overall, this code enhances the visual representation of the HTML elements within the  `block`  by adding a  `span-arrow`  element and applying specific styling to the first element if it is an image.
